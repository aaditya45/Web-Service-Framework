# Web-Service-Framework

Servlet programming can be very hectic sometimes. Web-service framework saves developers from writing an absurd amount of code and saves time.

For example, to accept a get request from a client, the user can use the "@Get" annotation on the service method along with the "@Path" annotation on the controller class to handle the request.
